# Asset Pricing in Complex Financial Markets - A Self-Organized Criticality Approach

## Description

In this project, we challenge the standard financial theories that assume homogeneous investors with rational expectations. Our model considers market dynamics driven by heterogeneous agents whose beliefs and expectations evolve through interaction within the market. We focus on the implications of imitative behavior and order book mechanisms on asset pricing, emphasizing the dynamics of self-organized criticality and their role in market efficiency. Our central inquiry investigates how the dynamics of order books and herding behavior among agents with endogenous, heterogeneous expectations influence market function and asset pricing. The project explores the complexity of these interactions and their effects on market efficiency and price stability.

## Getting Started

## Usage
Run all the cells in the Jupyter notebook file `redo_main.ipynb`, `redo_main-figures_in_page_21_12_in_ppt.ipynb` and `redo_return_price_QMW_distribution.ipynb` to get the visual results.

### Scripts

- `Constants.py`: Contains the parameters used across the models.
- `ContagionMechanism.py`: Defines the contagion mechanism of the model.
- `HelpingFunctions.py`: Utility functions used for various purposes within the model.
- `Main.py`: The main script that initializes and runs the simulations.
- `OrderBook.py`: Implements the order book mechanism of the asset market.

### Results

The `images` folder contains the output graphs and results from the simulations.

### Dependencies

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `random`: A built-in Python library for generating random numbers.
- `networkx`: For creating and manipulating complex networks.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and technical computing.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing data.
